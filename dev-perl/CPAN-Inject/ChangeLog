  +CPAN-Inject-0.10.ebuild, +files/Test-0.10.patch,
  +CPAN-Inject-0.11.ebuild, +files/Test-0.11.patch, +metadata.xml:
  Added 2 versions. Note theres a patch in the test suites there, because 
  the dir it tests for simply does not, and will never exist due to the
  build being done outside of a CPAN install.
