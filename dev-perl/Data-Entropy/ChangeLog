*Data-Entropy-0.006 (23 Nov 2009)

  23 Nov 2009; Kent Fredric <kentfredric@gmail.com>
  +Data-Entropy-0.006.ebuild:
  Bumped: 

  - be more stringent in parsing responses from networked entropy sources

  - in documentation, point more prominently to Data::Entropy::Algorithms

  - in documentation of Data::Entropy::Algorithms, more discussion of
  overriding CORE::rand, including how to override it globally

  - abandon use of the "fields" module

  - use simpler "parent" pragma in place of "base"

  - check for required Perl version at runtime

  - in test suite, properly quote first argument to use_ok (lack of quoting
  caused false test failures on Perl 5.11.2)

  - in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  - remove bogus "exit 0" from Build.PL
