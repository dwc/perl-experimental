  +files/0001-Change-how-wantarray-is-tweaked-to-work-better-with-.patch,
  +TryCatch-1.002000-r1.ebuild:
  Added patched version to get closer to upstream for perl-5.12 users. 
  Presenty its kinda broken on 5.12, but this makes it less broken, and most
  tests pass. It appears to only lack support for a few syntax checking
  nicities. However, its unofficial hackery, so its unsupported, and thus
  unkeyworded. If you unmask it, expect it to fail tests. =).
